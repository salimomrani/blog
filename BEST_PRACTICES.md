## 📝 Commit Messages

### Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style/formatting (no logic change)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Build process, dependencies, tooling
- `revert` - Revert previous commit

### Rules
1. **Subject line (50 chars max)**
   - Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
   - Don't capitalize first letter
   - No period at the end

2. **Body (72 chars per line)**
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - Separate from subject with blank line

3. **Footer**
   - Reference issues: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`
   - Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

### Examples

**Good:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implement automatic token refresh to improve user experience
and reduce authentication errors. Token refreshes 5 minutes
before expiration.

Closes #234
```

**Bad:**
```
Updated stuff
Fixed bug
WIP
```

## 🌿 Git Best Practices

### Branch Naming
- `feature/short-description` - New features
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` - Production hotfixes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring
- `docs/what-changed` - Documentation updates
- `test/what-tested` - Test additions

### General Rules
1. **Keep branches short-lived** - Merge frequently
2. **One concern per branch** - Single feature/fix per branch
3. **Update frequently** - Pull latest changes daily
4. **Clean history** - Squash unnecessary commits before merge
5. **Delete merged branches** - Keep repository clean

### Before Committing
- [ ] Code compiles/builds successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug statements (console.log, print, etc.)
- [ ] No sensitive data (passwords, keys, tokens)

### Commit Frequency
- **Commit often** - Small, logical units of work
- **One logical change per commit** - Easy to review and revert
- **Working state** - Each commit should leave code in working state

## 🔍 Code Quality

### General Principles

1. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility
   - Open/Closed
   - Liskov Substitution
   - Interface Segregation
   - Dependency Inversion

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Extract duplicated code into functions/methods
   - Use configuration files for repeated values
   - Create reusable components/modules

3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Simplest solution is often the best
   - Avoid over-engineering
   - Write code for humans, not machines

4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Don't implement features "just in case"
   - Add functionality when actually needed

### Code Organization

1. **Consistent naming conventions**
   - Variables: descriptive, meaningful names
   - Functions: verb-based names (getUserData, calculateTotal)
   - Classes: noun-based names (UserService, ArticleController)
   - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

2. **File organization**
   - One class/component per file
   - Group related files together
   - Consistent folder structure
   - Separate concerns (business logic, presentation, data access)

3. **Function/Method size**
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Ideal: < 20 lines
   - Maximum: 50 lines
   - Extract complex logic into separate functions

4. **Avoid deep nesting**
   - Maximum 3 levels of indentation
   - Use early returns
   - Extract nested logic into separate functions

## 📚 Documentation

### What to Document

1. **Code-level documentation**
   - Public APIs and interfaces
   - Complex algorithms
   - Non-obvious business logic
   - Workarounds and hacks (with explanation)

2. **README.md** (every project must have)
   - Project description
   - Prerequisites
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration
   - Contributing guidelines
   - License

3. **Architecture documentation**
   - High-level system design
   - Component interactions
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Technology stack

4. **API documentation**
   - Endpoints and methods
   - Request/response formats
   - Authentication requirements
   - Error codes

### Documentation Best Practices

- **Keep it up to date** - Update docs with code changes
- **Use examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Be concise** - Clear and to the point
- **Use diagrams** - Visual aids for complex concepts
- **Version documentation** - Match docs to code versions

### Comments Best Practices

**Good comments explain WHY:**
```
// Cache results for 5 minutes to reduce database load
// Customer requested this specific timeout value
```

**Bad comments explain WHAT (code should be self-explanatory):**
```
// Increment counter by 1
counter++;
```

**When to comment:**
- Complex business rules
- Performance optimizations
- Security considerations
- Workarounds for external issues
- TODO/FIXME with context

**When NOT to comment:**
- Obvious code
- Redundant information
- Outdated comments (delete them!)

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Pyramid

```
        /\
       /  \       E2E Tests (10%)
      /____\      - Expensive, slow, brittle
     /      \
    /        \    Integration Tests (20%)
   /__________\   - Test component interactions
  /            \
 /              \ Unit Tests (70%)
/________________\- Fast, reliable, cheap
```

### Testing Principles

1. **Write testable code**
   - Small, focused functions
   - Dependency injection
   - Avoid global state
   - Pure functions when possible

2. **Test behavior, not implementation**
   - Test public APIs
   - Don't test private methods directly
   - Refactoring shouldn't break tests

3. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern**
   ```
   // Arrange - Set up test data
   // Act - Execute the code being tested
   // Assert - Verify the result
   ```

4. **Test names should describe behavior**
   - Good: `should_return_error_when_user_not_found`
   - Bad: `test1`, `testGetUser`

5. **One assertion per test** (when practical)
   - Easier to identify failures
   - More maintainable

6. **Independent tests**
   - Tests should not depend on each other
   - Can run in any order
   - Isolated test data

### Code Coverage

- **Aim for 70-80%** minimum coverage
- **100% coverage ≠ bug-free** code
- **Focus on critical paths** first
- **Don't test for the sake of coverage**

### What to Test

✅ **Test:**
- Business logic
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- User workflows
- API contracts

❌ **Don't test:**
- Framework code
- Third-party libraries
- Trivial getters/setters
- Configuration files
